# Automail Software Design 
This is an assignment of one of my subjects. The context for this assignment is that mails are collected and delivered by Regular in the Automail Software System Design. 
Software principles applied for this project: Polymorphism, Pure Fabrication, Indirection, Low coupling, High cohesion. 


However, because of the high demands for delivery, me and my teammates have applied Polymorphism which is one of the GRASP principles to add 2 more types of robots called Fast Robots and Bulk Robots. Those 3 robots inherit from the abstract parent class called Robots. Any common behaviors among these 3 robots are in the parent class while varying behaviors are implemented in child classes -> low coupling ,increases efficiency for our software architecture design. 

As a business, we also need to charge clients. The total charge is service fees (look up to the WifiModem) + delivery fees depending types of robots. Insteading of calculating the service fee by looking up at the WifiModem , we add the third party WIFI Apdater and connect our domain system to this third party. Then this third party will be connected with WifiModem -> provide indirection, Pure Fabrication, High cohesion.
